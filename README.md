# metro-navigation
Application that simulates a google maps style navigation on the Montreal metro system.
You will have to input the name of the metro station you would like to go to. (Keep any french accents like Ã©, but replace spacebar with a "-")
Afterwards, click on the map that pops up to set a Start point. 
A red line will draw out the shortest metro path from the Start point to the station that was set as your destination.
